# Sentiment-Prediction-of-Reviews
The model built in this ipython notebook can predict the sentiment(polarity) of reviews(whether the given review is positive or negative). Model is built by training on millions of reviews provided by amazon through kaggle. Ipython notebook goes through stages like data acquisition, data preparation like data cleaning and data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, modeling, interpretation and clear communication of results. Vectorizations like bag of words, tf-idf(term frequency-inverse document frequency) word2vectorization, tf-idf weighted word2vectorization are used for converting text into numerical vectors.  Data Visualization is done using t-SNE(t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding). Basic techniques like K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes are used to build a model. Of all the models the best model achieved AUC score of 0.896.
